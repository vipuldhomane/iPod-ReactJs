Add event listener to capture rotation around wheel

    Look up https://zingchart.github.io/zingtouch/ library. And see how you can use its rotate event to capture rotate events. Final result should look something like this. Log onto the console when you move around the wheel.

    Change active menu item using wheel

Use rotate event (ZingTouch) you used to change the active menu item using distanceFromLast property attached to rotate event. Change the active item menu based on angle for ex. If angle changed>15 deg change the menu item.
Final result will look something like this.
Note: Add draggable:false to prevent drag on clicking and moving mouse pointer
